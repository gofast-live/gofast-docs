### Using Go

Make sure you have the Go installed:

https://go.dev/doc/install

Check if your `PATH` includes the Go bin directory. You can add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrci` file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Get the latest version of GoFast CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/gofast-live/gofast-cli/cmd/gofast@v1.2.1
```

### Downloading the binary

#### Linux

```bash
wget https://github.com/gofast-live/gofast-cli/releases/download/v1.2.1/gofast-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/gofast
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gofast
```

Log in and let it guide you through! Have fun :)

## Download the GoFast Repository

In case you have problems with the CLI, you can always download the repository. But please remember, the CLI is still the recommended way since it cleans and sets up the project for you:

```bash
curl -GLf \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
    https://admin.gofast.live/download \
    -d "email=<YOUR_EMAIL>" \
    --output gofast.zip
```
