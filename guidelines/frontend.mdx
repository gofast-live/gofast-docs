## Implementation Details

- We have two panels: **client** and **admin**.
- The **client panel** is built with SvelteKit, Next.js, or Vue.js.
- The **admin panel** is built with Go + HTMX.
- The **client panel** communicates with the main server using HTTP.
- The **admin panel** communicates with the main server using gRPC.

## Philosophy

- **Keep It Simple**: The frontend should be a thin layer, handling only UI and interactions.
- **Reusability First**: Build components that are modular and composable.
- **Consistency Matters**: Follow a unified design and behavior across components.
- **Optimized for Speed**: Prioritize fast, responsive UI performance.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Use only essential libraries to reduce bloat.

## Validation

- **Start with Native HTML**: Use built-in validation (required, pattern, min, max, etc.) whenever possible.
- **Server-Side When Needed**: Offload complex validation to the backend.
- **Clear User Feedback**: Show meaningful error messages, not just generic alerts.

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

- **TailwindCSS**: Standard across all frameworks.
- **Go + HTMX**: Uses Templ, Alpine.js, Morph plugin, and SSE plugin.
- **SvelteKit**: Focus on SSR, Form Actions, and Runes.
- **Next.js**: Emphasizes SSR, App Router, and Server Actions.
- **Vue.js**: Primarily for simple client-side rendering.
