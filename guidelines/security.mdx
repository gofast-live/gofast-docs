## Authentication

The main logic is located in the `system/jwt.go` file.

### JWT-Based Authentication

- JWT Authentication: The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with refresh token rotation for managing user sessions.
- Encryption: JWTs are encrypted using `EdDSA` for enhanced security.
- Server-Side Security: As much logic as possible is handled on the server side to maintain security.
- Token can be invalidated: Refresh tokens allow generating new JWTs and can be manually invalidated by clearing the `user_id` in the `user_tokens` table.
- Transport:
  - For `HTTP`, the tokens are sent in the `authorization` header as `Bearer` tokens.
  - For `gRPC`, the tokens are sent in the `metadata` as `authorization` tokens.
- Key Management:
  - Private/Public Key Pair: The system uses a private/public key pair for token validation.
  - Key Generation: To generate new keys, run the script:

```bash
cd scripts && sh key.sh
```

#### Generating Tokens

```go
jwtToken, jwtRefreshToken, err := system.GenerateTokens(refreshToken.Id, user.Id, user.Access, system.GetAccessRoutes(user.Access), user.Avatar, user.Email, subscriptionActive)
if err != nil {
    return nil, system.ErrUnauthorized{Err: fmt.Errorf("Error generating JWT token: %w", err)}
}
```

#### Validating Tokens

```go
user, err := system.ValidateToken(token)
if err != nil {
    return system.ErrUnauthorized{Err: err}
}
```

### Next.js specific implementation

Because of the limitaions of middleware in Next.js (Edge environment), the public key is stored in the environment variable `JWT_KEY` as string.

## Authorization

The main logic is located in the `system/access.go` file.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- The main authorization mechanism is based on [Discord permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions).
- Each user has a set of permissions that are checked against the required permissions for a given action.
- Permissions are stored in a variable-length integer serialized into a string, and are calculated using bitwise operations.
- This allows for a high level of granularity in permissions, a very low storage overhead, and fast permission checks.

#### Permissions Constants

```go
const (
	READ_NOTES  int64 = 0x0000000000000001
	INSERT_NOTE int64 = 0x0000000000000002
	UPDATE_NOTE int64 = 0x0000000000000004
	DELETE_NOTE int64 = 0x0000000000000008

	READ_PAYMENTS  int64 = 0x0000000000000010
	CREATE_PAYMENT int64 = 0x0000000000000020

	READ_EMAILS int64 = 0x0000000000000040
	SEND_EMAIL  int64 = 0x0000000000000080

	READ_FILES    int64 = 0x0000000000000100
	UPLOAD_FILE   int64 = 0x0000000000000200
	DOWNLOAD_FILE int64 = 0x0000000000000400
	DELETE_FILE   int64 = 0x0000000000000800
)
```

#### Checking Permissions

```go
access := system.NewAccess(user.Access)
if !access.HasAccess(system.READ_NOTES) {
    return system.ErrForbidden{Message: "Access denied"}
}
```

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

- The system also supports Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for more complex access control scenarios.
- Define policies in the `CheckUserAttr` function:

```go
func CheckUserAttr(access int64, userAttr *UserAttr) bool {
	if access == UPDATE_NOTE {
		return userAttr.Department == "IT" && userAttr.Position == "Developer"
	}
	if access == DELETE_NOTE {
		return userAttr.Department == "IT" && userAttr.Position == "Admin"
	}
	return true
}
```

And then check the access:

```go
if !system.NewAccessWithAttr(user.Access, userAttr).HasAccess(system.UPDATE_NOTE) {
    return system.ErrForbidden{Message: "Access denied"}
}
```
