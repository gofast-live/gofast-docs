## Workflow Overview

1. **Linting**
    - Before each section of the pipeline runs, we perform linting for various technologies (Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Go).
    - This helps catch issues early and maintain consistent code quality.

2. **Database Migration**
    - Before deploying the `service-go-user`, a database migration step runs to apply any new schema changes using the [AtlasGo](https://atlasgo.io/docs) tool.

3. **Build & Deployment**
    - Our build scripts automatically create Docker images, push them to the GitHub Container Registry, and deploy them to Kubernetes clusters.
    - We support two environments:
        - Staging: Triggered when a **release** is marked as a **pre-release**.
        - Production: Triggered when a full **release** is created.

## Required Secrets

Only two secrets are required for deployments:

- `KUBE_CONFIG`: The Kubernetes configuration file encoded in Base64. Generate it with:

```bash
    cat ~/.kube/config | base64
```
- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for the database.

## Set up Docker Images

To allow GitHub Actions to access your Docker images:

- Go to https://github.com/OWNER/packages and locate your Docker images.
- For each image, navigate to **Package Settings** â†’ **Manage Actions Access**.
- Click Add Repository, select your repo, and change the access level to **Write**.

This ensures that GitHub Actions can pull and push Docker images during the CI/CD process.
