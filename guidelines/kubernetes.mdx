## Overview

- This guide details how to deploy a GoFast application on a Kubernetes cluster with monitoring capabilities.
- The setup require a server with root access to deploy the Kubernetes cluster.
- Optionaly, you can add worker nodes to the cluster.
- Docker images are stored in the GitHub Container Registry.
- CloudNativePG is used to deploy a PostgreSQL database.

Additional note, all resources are build for the ARM64 architecture. If you are using a different architecture, please update the Dockerfiles and the deployment scripts accordingly.

**Important**: Run all commands from the `kube` directory.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Optional: [k9s](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/)

You’ll need server with root access:
- Production/Staging server (e.g. `12.34.56.78`)

Set up domains/subdomains:
- User Service (e.g. `user.gofast.live`)
- Admin Service (e.g. `admin.gofast.live`)
- Client Service (e.g. `client.gofast.live`)
- Monitoring (e.g. `grafana.gofast.live`)

These domains should resolve to the corresponding server IP addresses:

```
user.gofast.live -> 12.34.56.78
admin.gofast.live -> 12.34.56.78
client.gofast.live -> 12.34.56.78
grafana.gofast.live -> 12.34.56.78
```

Include AAAA records if using IPv6.

## Configure Environment Variables

You've got two options to set the environment variables:

1. Fill in the `.env` file with your secrets.
2. Pass the secrets as environment variables when running the scripts (preferred).
```bash
POSTGRES_USER=your_user \
POSTGRES_PASS=your_pass \
sh setup_kube.sh
```

## Install Kubernetes Cluster

Run the following command to set up the Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
sh setup_kube.sh
```

Monitor the cluster using the k9s tool:
```bash
k9s
```

## Authorize GitHub Container Registry

Generate a personal access token with `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes from [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 
Save it as `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` env and run:
```bash
sh setup_docker.sh
```

## Build Docker Images

If you don’t have a builder, create one:
```bash
docker buildx create --use
```

Build the Docker images for each service:
```bash
cd ../your-service
docker buildx build --platform $BUILD_PLATFORM -t ghcr.io/$GITHUB_REPO/$IMAGE_NAME:latest --push .
```
Replace:
- `$BUILD_PLATFORM` with the target platform (e.g., linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- `$GITHUB_REPO` with your GitHub Repo (e.g., gofast-live/gofast-app)
- `$IMAGE_NAME` with the image name (e.g., service-user, service-admin-rc)

### Set up Docker Images (Optional - For CI/CD)

Go `https://github.com/OWNER/packages` and connect the images to the repository.
Then for each image, go to Package Settings -> Manage Actions Access -> Add the repository -> Change to Write.

## Deploy PostgreSQL

This will add postgres to your cluster with a migration job and a backup job.
Deploy a PostgreSQL database using CloudNativePG:
```bash
sh deploy_postgres.sh
```

## Deploy the Application

```bash
sh deploy_app.sh
```

Check deployment status with:
```bash
kubectl get pods
# or
k9s
```

## Deploy Monitoring Stack

Set up the monitoring stack:
```bash
sh deploy_monitoring.sh
```
This scripts outputs the Grafana admin password.

## Deploy a New Version

To deploy an updated version, build and push new images, then restart the deployments:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment service-user
kubectl rollout restart deployment service-admin
kubectl rollout restart deployment service-client
```

## Auto Deploy using GitHub Actions

1. Switch to the desired context:
```bash
kubectl config use-context YOUR_CONTEXT
```

2. Copy the kubeconfig file:
```bash
cat ~/.kube/config
```

2. On the GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and add `KUBE_CONFIG` with the kubeconfig.

3. Create database url from `postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASS}@${MIGRATION_SERVER_IP}:30432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable` and add it to the GitHub Secrets as `DATABASE_URL`.

3. Modify the `deploy.yml` to match your environments and services.

## Framework Specific Instructions

For the Next.js and Vue.js clients, we need to update the build environment variables.

To deploy a Next.js client, point `NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_URL` inside Dockerfile to your user service URL.

To deploy a Vue.js client, point `VITE_USER_URL` inside Dockerfile to your user service URL.
