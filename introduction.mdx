## What is GoFast?

The Ultimate Foundation for building High-Performance, Scalable, Modern Web Applications. Backed by a powerful CLI.

Not 'built in days' bullshit.

You will need to code.

But it will work.

## Architecture

![Overview](/images/diagram.webp)

## Features

GoFast is powered by the CLI that will guide you through the configuration:
- SvelteKit, NextJS, Vue.js, or HTMX
- HTTP and gRPC
- OAuth flow without any external provider + Magic Links
- Payments with secure webhooks using Stripe or Lemon Squeezy
- Emails sending using Postmark, Sengrid, Resend, or AWS SES
- Files storage using Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage
- Proper CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions, with auto releases
- Grafana Loki + Prometheus Monitoring
- Full Kubernetes setup with Helm charts + Victoria Metrics + CloudNativePG

## Philosophy

- The backbone of the app is Go, which handles all the important logic. Why Go?
    - Go is a simple language with exceptional performance.
    - Due to Go's straightforward nature, there aren't countless ways to do things, making code review and consistency much easier.
    - One of its undervalued strengths is its ease of introduction to new programmers.
    - Go has an amazing set of native libraries.
    - Errors as values are amazing.
- We believe that combining a robust backend language with a "simple" frontend framework is the best way to build a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance application.
- We primarily use Dependency Injection and the Strategy Pattern, keeping abstractions to a minimum. Always go for simplicity.
- Minimize external dependencies: This enhances code maintainability and simplifies long-term changes. It's the way to go. It will make your life simpler.
