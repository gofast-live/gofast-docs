## Implementation Details

- We have two panels: **client** and **admin**.
- The **client panel** is built with SvelteKit, Next.js, or Vue.js.
- The **admin panel** is built with HTMX.
- The **client panel** communicates with the main server using HTTP.
- The **admin panel** communicates with the main server using gRPC.

## Configuration

The **admin** panel with HTMX will always be available. You can choose between SvelteKit, Next.js, or Vue.js for the **client** panel. The recommended way to do it is by using the GoFast CLI.

## Troubleshooting

- When running Vite on WSL2, file system watching does not work when a file is edited by Windows applications (non-WSL2 process). Check Vite docs for solutions: https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-watch
