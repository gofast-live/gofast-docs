## Configuration

This is one of the settings that will require some coding.


## Troubleshooting

- When running Docker on WSL2, the SQLite file may not work. In that case, you probably need to exclude it from volumes:

```
    volumes:
      - ./go:/server
      - /server/storage/db/
    environment:
      DB_PROVIDER: sqlite
      SQLITE_FILE: /server/storage/db/local.db
```
