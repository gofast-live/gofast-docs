## Implementation

- Database Migration: [AtlasGo](https://atlasgo.io/docs)
- SQL generation: [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev)
- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), or [Turso](https://turso.tech/)

## Basic Flow

1. Spin up the docker compose.
2. Make changes to the `service-core/storage/schema.sql` file.
3. Run **AtlasGo** migration:

```bash
sh scripts/atlas.sh
```

4. Modify `service-core/storage/queries.sql` file.
5. Run **sqlc** to generate the SQL code:

```bash
sh scripts/sqlc.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

- When running Docker on WSL2, the SQLite file may not work. In that case, you probably need to exclude it from volumes:

```
    volumes:
      - ./service-code:/serivce
      - /serivce/storage/
    environment:
      DB_PROVIDER: sqlite
      SQLITE_FILE: /service/storage/data.db
```
