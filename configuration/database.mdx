## Implementation

- Database Migration: [AtlasGo](https://atlasgo.io/docs)
- SQL generation: [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev)
- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Turso](https://turso.tech/), or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

## Basic Flow

1. Spin up the docker compose.
2. Make changes to the `service-go-user/storage/schema.sql` file.
3. Run **AtlasGo** migration:

```bash
sh scripts/atlas.sh
```

4. Modify `service-go-user/storage/queries.sql` file.
5. Run **sqlc** to generate the SQL code:

```bash
sh scripts/sqlc.sh
```

## Change Database

By default, the project uses local **PostgreSQL**. To change the database, you need to modify the following files:

- `service-go-user/storage/storage.go` - change the database implementation by commenting/uncommenting the database provider.
- `service-go-user/storage/sqlc.yaml` - change the database configuration. - https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/tutorials/getting-started-sqlite.html
- `service-go-user/storage/schema.sql` - change the schema to match the new database.
- `service-go-user/storage/queries.sql` - change the queries to match the new database.
- `scripts/atlas.sh` - change the database connection string and docker dev image - https://atlasgo.io/concepts/dev-database

## Troubleshooting

- When running Docker on WSL2, the SQLite file may not work. In that case, you probably need to exclude it from volumes:

```
    volumes:
      - ./go:/server
      - /server/storage/db/
    environment:
      DB_PROVIDER: sqlite
      SQLITE_FILE: /server/storage/db/local.db
```
