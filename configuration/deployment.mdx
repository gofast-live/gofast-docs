## Implementation

We provide two ways of deploying your application:
- **Kubernetes**: A full guide on deploying your application using:
    - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
    - [VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/)
    - [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/)
- **Docker**: A preconfigured **Docker Compose** setup with corresponding multistage **Dockerfiles** for each service, including optional **Grafana + Loki + Prometheus Monitoring** stack.

The recommended approach is to use **Kubernetes** for production and **Docker** for development, as the **CI/CD** pipeline is optimized for Kubernetes.

## Configuration

This choice must be made using the **GoFast CLI**. Possible options are `Kubernetes + VictoriaMetrics Monitoring`, `Grafana + Loki + Prometheus Monitoring` and `None`.

## Kubernetes

A complete deployment guide is available in [Kubernetes](/guidelines/kubernetes) and in [CI/CD](/guidelines/cicd) sections or in project `kube/README.md` directory.

## Docker

Each service includes its own multistage **Dockerfile**, with the full stack managed by **Docker Compose**.

For production, switch the **docker-compose.yml** stage from `dev` to `prod`.

For additional monitoring, use the **Grafana + Loki + Prometheus Monitoring** stack. See `grafana/README.md` directory for more information.
