## Implementation

We provide two ways of deploying your application:
- **Kubernetes**: A full guide on deploying your application using **Kubernetes**, with **VictoriaMetrics** as the monitoring solution and optional **CloudNativePG** as the database.
- **Docker**: A preconfigured **Docker Compose** setup with corresponding multistage **Dockerfiles** for each service, including optional **Grafana + Loki + Prometheus Monitoring** stack.

The recommended way is to use **Kubernetes** for production and **Docker** for development, mostly because of the **CI/CD** is prepared for Kubernetes.

## Configuration

This choice must be made using the **GoFast CLI**. Possible options are `Kubernetes + VictoriaMetrics Monitoring`, `Grafana + Loki + Prometheus Monitoring` and `None`.

## Kubernetes

A complete deployment guide is available in **kube/README.md**.

## Docker

Each service includes its own multistage **Dockerfile**, with the full stack managed by **Docker Compose**.

For production, switch the **docker-compose.yml** stage from `dev` to `prod`.

For additional monitoring, use the **Grafana + Loki + Prometheus Monitoring** stack. See `grafana/README.md` for details.
