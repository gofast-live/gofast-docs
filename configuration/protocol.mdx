## Implementation

- **HTTP (SvelteKit, Next.js, or Vue.js)** is used between the client panel  and the main server.
- **gRPC (HTMX)** is used between the admin panel and the main server.

## gRPC generation

Make sure you have the latest version of the `protoc-gen-go` plugin installed:

```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```

For gRPC implementation, all proto files are inside the `proto` folder. After making any changes, we need to generate new types:

```bash
sh scripts/proto.sh
```
